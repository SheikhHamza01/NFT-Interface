    <div class="owner">
        <h1 class="ques">Ownership</h1>
        <h4 class="ans">What it means to own a Praying Hands Club NFT.</h4>
        <p class="ans">i. You own the NFT. Each Praying Hand is an NFT on the Ethereum blockchain. When you purchase an NFT, you own
            the underlying Praying Hand, the Art, completely. Ownership of the NFT is mediated entirely by the Smart
            Contract and the Ethereum Network: at no point may we seize, freeze, or otherwise modify the ownership of
            any Praying Hand.</p>

        <p class="ans"> ii. Personal Use. Subject to your continued compliance with these Terms, Yump Creative LLC grants you a
            worldwide, royalty-free license to use, copy, and display the purchased Art, along with any extensions that
            you choose to create or use, solely for the following purposes: (i) for your own personal, non-commercial
            use; (ii) as part of a marketplace that permits the purchase and sale of your Praying Hand / NFT, provided
            that the marketplace cryptographically verifies each Praying Hand owner’s rights to display the Art for
            their Praying Hand to ensure that only the actual owner can display the Art; or (iii) as part of a third
            party website or application that permits the inclusion, involvement, or participation of your Praying Hand,
            provided that the website/application cryptographically verifies each Praying Hand owner’s rights to display
            the Art for their Praying Hand to ensure that only the actual owner can display the Art, and provided that
            the Art is no longer visible once the owner of the Praying Hand leaves the website/application.
        </p>
        <p class="ans"> iii. Commercial Use. Subject to your continued compliance with these Terms, Yump Creative LLC grants you an
            unlimited, worldwide license to use, copy, and display the purchased Art for the purpose of creating
            derivative works based upon the Art (“Commercial Use”). Examples of such Commercial Use would e.g. be the
            use of the Art to produce and sell merchandise products (T-Shirts etc.) displaying copies of the Art. For
            the sake of clarity, nothing in this Section will be deemed to restrict you from (i) owning or operating a
            marketplace that permits the use and sale of Praying Hands generally, provided that the marketplace
            cryptographically verifies each Praying Hand owner’s rights to display the Art for their Praying Hand to
            ensure that only the actual owner can display the Art; (ii) owning or operating a third party website or
            application that permits the inclusion, involvement, or participation of Praying Hands generally, provided
            that the third party website or application cryptographically verifies each Praying Hand owner’s rights to
            display the Art for their Praying Hand to ensure that only the actual owner can display the Art, and
            provided that the Art is no longer visible once the owner of the purchased Praying Hand leaves the
            website/application; or (iii) earning revenue from any of the foregoing.</p>
